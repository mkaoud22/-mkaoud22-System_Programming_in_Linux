# ðŸ“š System Programming in Linux â€” Coursework Repository

Welcome to my repository for the **System Programming in Linux** course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/spl01-system-programming-in-linux/). This repository contains the source code and exercises I completed while successfully working through the course.

## ðŸ“– About the Course

**System Programming in Linux** is a practical, hands-on course that covers low-level programming concepts in Linux using the C language. It focuses on working directly with the Linux system API and interfaces, covering areas such as process management, file handling, inter-process communication, shell development, and system calls.

```


## ðŸ“Œ Projects Included
- **Unix Utilities in C** â€” Custom versions of standard Unix/Linux command-line utilities (`cp`, `mv`, `pwd`, `echo`)
- **Lush (Linux User Shell)** â€” A custom user shell implemented in C

## ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used

- **C Language**
- **Linux System Programming**
- **GCC Compiler**
- **Bash / Git / GitHub**

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Work

I plan to:
- Improve the Lush shell by adding new built-in commands
- Optimize the utility implementations
- Document each utility with a detailed README and usage instructions
